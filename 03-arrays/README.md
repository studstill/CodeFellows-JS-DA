Data Structures and Algorithms I

This repo contains my re-implementation the following methods for
Array.prototype, without using any library functions. I have Also addded
some Mocha tests to verify correctness:

  1. Push

  2. Pop

  3. Shift

  4. Unshift

In addition, I've provided my solutions to the following exercises:

  5. Implement a function called "unique" that takes an array and
     returns a copy of the array with all the duplicates removed.

  6. Implement a function called "frequency2" that, when given an array
     of english words, returns what the most common letter
     (anywhere in a word) is.
