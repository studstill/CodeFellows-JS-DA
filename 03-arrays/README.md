Data Structures and Algorithms I

This repo contains my re-implementation the following methods for
Array.prototype, without using any library functions. I have also addded
some Mocha tests to verify correctness:

  - Push

  - Pop

  - Shift

  - Unshift

In addition, I've provided my solutions to the following exercises:

  - Implement a function called "unique" that takes an array and
     returns a copy of the array with all the duplicates removed.

  - Implement a function called "frequency2" that, when given an array
     of english words, returns what the most common letter
     (anywhere in a word) is.



*** TO RUN TESTS ***

 - Clone this repo to a local directory

 - Open your terminal and navigate to the cloned repo

 - Type 'npm install' and press enter

 - Type 'mocha' and press enter to see the test results.
