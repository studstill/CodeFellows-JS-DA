// For this assignment you will be building a Bitmap reader and transformer.
// It will read a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on
// the bitmap and then write it out to a new file. This project will require
// the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your project
// should include tests, as well as a Gruntfile and package.json file. Make
// sure to run all your code through jshint and jscs. The process will look
// something like this:

// 1. open file using fs and read it into a buffer

// 2. convert buffer into a Javascript Object

// 3. Run a transform on that Javascript Object.

// 4. Turn the transformed object back into a buffer.

// 5. Write that buffer to a new file.
